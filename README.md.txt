# 🌬️ Project Vaayu — Predictive Air Quality Intelligence

**Project Vaayu** is a comprehensive, multi-phase initiative focused on accurate and scalable Air Quality Index (AQI) prediction and forecasting. Spanning classical machine learning, statistical time-series analysis, and deep learning architectures, the project aims to identify the most effective modeling approach for environmental health forecasting in Indian urban regions—specifically Hyderabad.

The codes for each phase are provided in a edited version due to privacy restrictions. For detailed and complete modules, try reaching out through email or LinkedIn.
Project Vaayu is divided into three distinct but interrelated phases:

---

### 🧩 **Phase 1: ML-Based AQI Prediction and Model Benchmarking**

This phase focuses on building and comparing four core machine learning models:
**Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, **CatBoost**, and **Bagging Regressor**.
These models are trained on pollutant and meteorological data spanning 10 years (2013–2023) collected from 13 CPCB-monitored stations in Hyderabad. The goal is to assess each model’s predictive accuracy, generalization capacity, and real-world deployment readiness using metrics like MAE, RMSE, R², and MAPE.

### 📈 **Phase 2: Time-Series AQI Forecasting with LSTM and ARIMA/SARIMA**

This phase applies both classical and deep learning time-series models to forecast future AQI values.

* **ARIMA** and **SARIMA** provide statistical baselines by modeling linear temporal structures.
* **LSTM** captures long-term dependencies and nonlinear patterns in sequential pollutant data.
  The models are rigorously validated and tuned to identify which approach is better suited for short-to-medium term AQI forecasting.

### 🤖 **Phase 3: Deep Learning Architecture Evaluation (LSTM vs GRU)**

This segment investigates the performance of two advanced deep learning models—**LSTM** and **GRU**—on normalized AQI data. The objective is to identify which recurrent neural architecture provides more stability, faster convergence, and higher predictive accuracy for AQI values over unseen data.

### 🎯 **Why Project Vaayu?**

> With urban air quality becoming a critical public health issue, Project Vaayu aims to provide a data-driven, modular, and extensible framework for AQI prediction that can power smart city dashboards, alert systems, and long-term planning tools.
